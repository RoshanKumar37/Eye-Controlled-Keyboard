AI Virtual Keyboard

We can control the keyboard with our eyes and type using them thanks to a tool called AI Virtual Keyboard. In this application, the keyboard was separated into two sections: left and right.


	Functioning:
1.	Moving your iris in the preferred direction will allow you to choose which side of the keyboard you want to use. The keyboard's keys on that side will appear on a screen.

2.	If you want to press a key, wait for the alphabet to get highlighted and when it gets highlighted just close your eyes and your key will get selected.

3.	If you want to go back and select the other side of the keyboard, just select the angular bracket and then you will be on the previous screen.

This project is still under development so you might face some accuracy problem.
